# booksy-pages
The website is not mine, here are just some recreated pages of the website in the purpose of exercising SASS preprocessor and BEM metodology.

</br>
</br>
In order to view this project, you have to clone or download the repository and open in your browser any desired page you wish to observe.
</br>
If you want to make any changes, you have to open a terminal in the source folder of the project and run **npm install** in order for the SASS dependencies to be installed, and also run a script **npm run compile:sass** which I created in order for SASS to observe any changes that are made in the project, and recompile the CSS if needed.
</br>
</br>
I also uploaded a preview of the homepage down below, there are other preview images in the **preview** folder in this repository.
</br>
The technologies used were : CSS preprocessor SASS along with BEM metodology and HTML.
